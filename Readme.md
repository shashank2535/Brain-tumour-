Timely recognition of brain tumors is crucial for the efficient treatment of patients. With the
advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, there is an opportunity to
automate brain tumor detection completely using machine learning. However, beware, a
wrong prediction may be fatal to life! Can you implement a model to classify Brain MRIs as
having a tumor or not? Can you further classify which type of tumor is present?

About the Dataset: The training dataset contains images belonging to one of the following
classes :
No tumor
Meningioma tumor
Glioma tumor
Pituitary tumor

The tumor types of these images have been given in the ‘trainset.csv’ file.
The testing dataset consists of images without labels.
